# OPS COMMANDER
# Provides a simple interface that allows those with permissions to:
# Alert -> Starts an alert coroutine, users signed up are pinged at 10 minute intervals.  Channels are created in prep.
# Start Ops -> Self explanitory, starts an op event.
# Debrief -> Begin a debrief process; after 5 minutes normal users are moved to 'planetside' channel, commanders are moved to 'command' channel, channels are cleaned up.
#			 Users are offered the ability to provide anonymised feedback via the bot regarding the event.  This is fed to the command channel.
# End Ops -> Removes the signup.
